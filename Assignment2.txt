2. What are three different types of boolean operators

	The three different types of Boolean Operators are 
	
	1. and 
	2. or 
	3. not

3. Make a List of Each boolean operators truth tables[i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evulates)


Value 1	Value 2	and (operator)		Value1	Value2	or(Operator)			Value1	Not (Operator)
TRUE	FALSE	FALSE				TRUE	FALSE	TRUE					TRUE	FALSE	
TRUE	TRUE	TRUE				TRUE	TRUE	TRUE					FALSE	TRUE
